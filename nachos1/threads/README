5. This program should be run by invoking ./nachos -P 5 [numberOfUsers] 
	Currently, the number of floors is set in the elevator_manager.h file. 
	This can be changed by changing the static const int numberOfPeople 	
	
	Our implemtation runs by having each person declare what floor they 
	would like to get off on, and which floor they are currently on, for 
	the user to see. These floors are generated randomly using a seed of 
	10. The people declare when they enter the elevator, and when they 
	get off the elevator. The elevator tells the user when it moves from
	floor to floor. The elevator starts at floor 0 by default. 

	To verify correctness, one needs to know the basic idea of the elevator 
	paradigmn, where the elevator will pick people up in passes. So depending
	on the number of people, the elevator will alternate upsweeps and downsweeps
	as needed until all of the clients are served. This can be verified by
	reading the output and visually confirming that people going up are 
	picked up first, followed by people going down. 
	
	Due to the way nachos impelements threads, it is very difficult for the 
	elevator to have to do more than one upsweep and one downsweep. THis
	is because each person ends up declaring their intent before the elevator 
	begins serving the requests. Multiple passes can be acheived by 
	modifying interrupt times and number of passengers though. 

	To note, when the random interupts are enabled, the output will become jumbled.
	This is because it is possible for a person to be interuppted before 
	stating that they have gotten off the elevator.
