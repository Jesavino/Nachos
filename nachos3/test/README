Source File         Desired Behavior
===========         ================
bogus2.c            Program shouldn't even start to execute,
                    but no ASSERT violation should happen.

parent.c            A 2-process system: parent Exec()s
kid.c               kid and Join()s kid when it Exit()s.
                    Parent should get the Exit status value
                    from kid. 

wideexec.c          Wideexec Execs three kids and waits
widekid1.c          for them to terminate. May want to
widekid2.c          kick up NumPhysPages in machine.h
widekid3.c          to run this.

deepexec.c          The deepexec program Execs kid4 and waits
kid4.c              for it. The kid4 program execs kid5 and
kid5.c              waits for it.

toobig.c            Rigged so that the Exec() in toobig should
kid6.c              fail. See comments in toobig.c for expected
                    behavior/output.

argtest.c           The argtest program Exec()s argkid, passing
argkid.c            2 arguments. Note that this requires the
                    Exec(char *, char *[], int) prototype.
