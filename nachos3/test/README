Source File         Desired Behavior
===========         ================
matmult.c           Make sure NumPhysPages is set to 32
                    in machine/machine.h. This program
                    is then too big to fit in RAM, and
                    will exercise your VM system.

                    Intended to be run stand-alone (it
                    issues a Halt() after it's output).

                    After this runs standalone, change
                    the Halt() to an Exit(0) and run
                    it under your shell.

vmtorture.c         A system of process to really beat
Xkid.c              hell out of your VM implementation.
qmatmult.c          vmtorture fires up a "quiet" matmult
qsort.c             that doesn't do any console output,
                    a quiet sort, and 5 instances of Xkid.
                    An Xkid is given a single char (A, B,
                    C, D, and E) as its argument. It then
                    outputs 100 copies of the argument to
                    the console. Should see lots of inter-
                    leaving of the letters.
