// The following class defines an entry in a translation table -- either
// in a page table or a TLB.  Each entry defines a mapping from one

// In addition, there are some extra bits for access control (valid and 
// read-only) and some bits for usage information (use and dirty).

		int diskPage;				// The disk segment the page lives on
    bool valid;         // If this bit is set, the translation is ignored.
			// (In other words, the entry hasn't been initialized.)
