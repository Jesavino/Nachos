Source File         Desired Behavior
===========         ================
bogus2.c            Program shouldn't even start to execute,
                    but no ASSERT violation should happen.

parent.c            A 2-process system: parent Exec()s
kid.c               kid and Join()s kid when it Exit()s.
                    Parent should get the Exit status value
                    from kid.
